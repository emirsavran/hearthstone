# Sample React Native App

This app gets and filters Hearthstone cards based on mechanics. This is a sample project. Unfortunately, I don't have Mac, so it is only tested with Android and `SafeAreaView` is disregarded. As a side note, the search function can be improved.

For a decent test, please use the Android release APK. To get a release, run the following command in the project directory:

`yarn run android-release`

To install the connected device:

`adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
